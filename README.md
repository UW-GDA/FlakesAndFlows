# Saturated Sauk

### Members: Max Strecher, Hailey Sparks, Jesse Akes

### Summary
The goal of this project is to model and classify high flow events on the Sauk river in Washington state. Using streamflow gauge data and nearby SNOTEL sites,
we aim to determine peak over threshold flow events and what meterological conditions led to them. 

### Background

### Problem Statement/Questions/Objectives
* Are we able to model and classify events (snow, rain, or rain on snow) that cause high flows/pulses (peak over threshold events) in the Sauk river?
* What meterological conditions are required to cause these events?
* Are we able to predict peak over thresholds given these events and coniditons?
